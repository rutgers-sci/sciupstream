Modules and themes for the base of a Rutgers SC&I site - for labs, centers, etc.

Contributed modules should go into contrib folder.

Main theme will be Bootstrap.

There will be a subtheme called scib --- ??? maybe.
Maybe individual sites can have scib theme as Parent Theme.  Need to test this.

When does a site get notified of a change?
